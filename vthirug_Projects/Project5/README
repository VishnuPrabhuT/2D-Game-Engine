Project no: 5

Project due date: 11/29/2017

Project description: Incorporate more action and interaction into your animation

The easiest part of this project: Shooting

Problems that I had in completing this project: Explosion by chunks as tweaked the framework a bit so, used Multisprite explosions

Game Description: Easter is the hero of this game trying to save his brother Master(Work in Progress) on the other end blocked by NPCs along the way who drop bombs to hinder the player's progress. Easter will have more powers like roll and lightning strike to take down different types of land monsters. For example, Water(Blue) monsters will be killed by lightning strike.

I'll make some NPCs shoot downward and add a super move for the player to take out NPCs which are out of reach.
