Project no: 4

Project due date: 11/13/2017

Project description: Creating a HUD, AI NPCs, Collisions and a player

The easiest part of this project: Controlling the player

Problems that I had in completing this project: Had trouble with accessing the right instances of sprite objects

Game Description: Easter is the hero of this game trying to save his brother Master(Work in Progress) on the other end blocked by NPCs along the way who drop bombs to hinder the player's progress. Easter will have more powers like roll and lightning strike to take down different types of land monsters. For example, Water(Blue) monsters will be killed by lightning strike.

I'll be adding more NPCs, shooting(with object pooling) and explosions in future iterations.
